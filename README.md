# Movie-rating-prediction-python-machinelearning

**INTRODUCTION**
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the ratings of movies based on their features such as genre, director, and main actors. We'll use data from IMDb, which provides information about many movies, including their ratings. By analyzing this data and using regression techniques, we aim to build a model that can estimate a movie's rating before it's released. This could help movie producers, critics, and fans get an early idea of how a movie might be received.

**DATA COLLECTION**
My source here is have used IMDb datasets from Kaggle using IMDbPY library
The attributes are:
Movie title
Genre
Director
Main actors
Release year
IMDb rating

**DATA PREPROCESSING**
Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicate values, and inconsistent data.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data (e.g., genre, director, actors) into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding.
Normalize numerical features if necessary.
Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

**MODEL BUILDING**
Feature Selection: Select important features which are important and impact the rating.
Model Selection: Choose regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**MODEL TRAINING**
Implementation: Implement it with different regression models on the training dataset to test the flexibility of the model.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.

**EVALUATION**
Evaluate the model using Techniques like Recall,Precision,Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.

**Model Deployment**
Model Deployment is the model which we have been trained to make is use in the real world scenarios or simply to apply the model in the environment to know how it works and which helps to improve it better with drawbacks by using the model upon untrained data.
Best Model: Select the model with the best performance metrics.
Predictions: Use the model to predict ratings for unseen movies or any new movies.

**CONCLUSION**
Summarize the findings and the performance of the model.
Discuss potential and further improvements and future work.
